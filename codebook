mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
subject - The person associated with this sample.
activity - The type of activity the person was doing during this sample 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

Implementing Steps:
1First you need to get the data online
then you read the data into R work space(x_train.txt...)
merge training and test data together.
name the data table's column by feature.txt

2extract the info needed
There are 66 columns involving basic mean and standard deviation,just extract them into 66 column's table.

3compare activity with the number of y, and replace y's number with activity.
Attach the activity to main table
Attach subject to the main table

4using better description for different columns

5Using split and lapply or tapply to get the average data according to subject & activity, should be 180 rows ,66 columns finally
